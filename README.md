>[Vtu Result for CBCS Scheme](http://results.vtu.ac.in/vitaviresultcbcs/index.php)

#### Description:

* Here, the program will ask the user to input a set of university role number either through a file or a set of range or manually.
* After getting the required input, the program will automatically fetch the required details from the website and store it in an excel file.


#### Advantage:
* For achieving the above task manually, it will take a minimum of 5 minutes for **_each USN_**, but our program can complete the entire task of fetching **_all USN_** in just 5 minutes or a little more.

* Saving the time of organization by automating the boring stuffs with python.
